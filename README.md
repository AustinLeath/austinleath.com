# THINGS TO DO

1. Implement primary website structure

2. Finish first draft of website content

3. Create smooth transitions between web pages

4. Work to link all projects together on one website to run well on the host device (a Raspberry Pi model 2B)

5. Get a free SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certification from certbot.net which will add the "S" to the end of "HTTP" so that my site will officially be secure
