When you start out, you have a skill-rating of 25. This value\r\n                            gets updated by playing. Basically, the better you perform, the higher your\r\n                            skill-rating.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Because such system can't be perfect, another variable exists: <i>uncertainty</i>. As\r\n                            the name suggests, uncertainty models how accurate your skill-rating is. As you play,\r\n                            the uncertainty value constantly falls and approaches zero: \"Perfect certainty\". The\r\n                            points you see in-game is called the mmr (MatchMaking Rating). This value is calculated\r\n                            from your skill-rating, and up until Red Crow, also took your playtime into\r\n                            consideration.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            How does this relate to the leaderboard? When we decided on creating one, we had to find\r\n                            a stat to use as ranking. In our opinion win-rate and kill-death-ratio are not suitable\r\n                            for that, because they are easily skewed. For example:\r\n                            <blockquote>\r\n                                In Season 2 (Dust Line) we managed to go on a 80 win streak in ranked. <br />\r\n                                We even managed to bring one of our mates up to a 54 win/loss ratio (thats 98%).\r\n                                There were (and still are) obviously way better players than us, but we had the nice\r\n                                stats.\r\n                            </blockquote>\r\n                            We'd be \"better\" than most players, even though we really are not (well, except one).{\" \"}\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            After a bit of thinking we realized, that the game already tracks player performance:\r\n                            the skill-rating. By taking the skill-rating and subtracting the uncertainty, we get a\r\n                            value that basically describes the concept of 'you are guaranteed to be at least this\r\n                            good'. <br />\r\n                            We feel that this value is the safest and closest we can get to an accurate\r\n                            representation of player ability.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            TLDR: <em>\"skill-rating\" = skill - uncertainty</em>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Of course, the board is skewed towards pre-made teams (as they have a significantly\r\n                            higher win-rate), but given the data we have, its the best metric.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Question>\r\n                    <Question question=\"When I search for my name it says that I haven't played the game yet...\">\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The error can be triggered in multiple ways:\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>we didn't grab your data yet.
